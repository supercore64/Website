	<h2>What is a Biome?</h2>
	<p>A biome is a community of plants and animals that have common characteristics for the environment they exist in. They can be found over a range of continents.
	Biomes are distinct biological communities that have formed in response to a shared physical climate. They are often defined by abiotic factors such as temperature,
	climate, relief, geology, soils and vegetation. Biomes play a crucial role in sustaining life. For example, the terrestrial biomes provide food and habitats for 
	animals, as well as absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Each biome has a different climate which in turn, affects the soil.<br>
	The earth's land areas are divided into six major biomes; tundra, taiga, grasslands, desert, temperate forests and tropical rainforests.
	A biome can either be terrestrial (land-based) or aquatic (water-based).</p>
	
	<h2>Types of Biomes</h2>
	
	<h3>Tundra</h3>
	<p>Tundra biomes are the coldest places on Earth. They are similar to a cold desert except they recieve less rainfall and contain different animals and plants.
	Even though the conditions are harsh, the tundra biome does have plant and animal habitats.</p>
	
	<h3>Taiga</h3>
	<p>The Taiga biome is the largest terrestrial biome and extends across Europe, North America and Asia. It is located right below the tundra biome.
	The Taiga biome is also known as a coniferous forest or boreal forest. This biome typically has short, wet summers and long, cold winters.
	Precipitation is moderate in the Taiga biome. It gets plenty of snow during the winter and plenty of rainfall during the summer.</p>
	
	<h3>Grasslands</h3>
	<p>The Grassland biome is made of rolling hills of various grasses. They recieve just enough rain to sustain grass but not enough to grow many trees.
	There are a few trees that will grow in grasslands but sporadic wildfires keep them under control. There are two types of grasslands; the savannas and temperate grasslands.</p>
	
	<h3>Desert</h3>
	<p>The Desert biome has one major, distinguishing characteristic, the fact that it has very little vegetation. The climate is rather extreme depending on its location.
	The deserts of Africa are extremely hot during the winters and warm throughout the rest of the year. There are also cold deserts such as those in Antartica. 
	These deserts are extremely cold during the winter and cold during other seasons.</p>
	
	<h3>Forest</h3>
	<p>The forest biome is the largest and has a wide variety of plants, trees, animals, insects and microscopic organisms. The major characteristic of the forest biome
	is its trees. About 30% of the Earth is considered a part of the forest biome. The forest biome is subdivided by its climate and types of trees present. 
	Those subdivisions include the rainforest biome, temperate biome, chaparral biome, alpine biome, and taiga biome.</p>
	
	<h2>Climate and Biomes</h2>
	
	<h3>Cimate</h3>
	<p>Climate is the average type of weather, including seasonal changes, over a period of time. It is defined by temperature variations and frequency and volume
	of rainfall within that year.</p>
	
	<h3>Linking Biomes and Climate</h3>
	<p>Biomes are defined by the dominant type of vegetation. Vegetation relies on specific biomes to establish. The patterns of biomes across the globe are linked to 
	the types of climate across the globe. If the climate dramatically changes from tropical to arid, then the forests would no longer be able to survive.</p>
	
	<h3>Factors that Affect Climate</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Latitude- north, south of the equator</li>
		<li>Landforms- mountain ranges can influence rainfall</li>
		<li>Elevation- the height above sea level, the cooler the climate</li>
	</ul>
