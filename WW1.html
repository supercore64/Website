	<h2>The Gallipoli Campaign</h2>
	<p>The Gallipoli Campaign was planned for the sole reason of knocking the Ottoman Empire from World War I, through the Gallipoli Peninsula. The attack on 
	Gallipoli started on March 1915, and began by a naval bombardment through the Dardanelles. A land attack on Gallipoli was planned soon after by the route of the 
	Aegan Sea, in hope of surprising the Turks and defeating them quickly to capture their capital, Constantinople (now Instanbul). The quick defeat on the Turks would 
	then open up supply lines to Russia and the Eastern Front. The planned quick defeat however, never occurred as it soon turned into a stalemate for the Allies
	and eventually ended in defeat.</p>
	<p>On April 25th 1915, ground troops from Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, India and the British dominion of Newfoundland (now a Canadian province) landed on the 
	Gallipoli peninsula. The campaign was in trouble from the beginning. As the Australian and New Zealand troops landed at what was now called Anzac Cove, they faced cliffs 
	up to 100-metres high and heavy resistance from behind the Turkish fortifications. Those soldiers who made it to the beach were unprotected as they faced the Turkish guns.
	Although the plan had been to make seven kilometres of progress, the day ended with barely one kilometre achieved. More than 600 Australian soldiers were kiled on the 
	first day of the campaign. Conditions at Gallipoli were extremely difficult. The Allies landed in the Turkish spring. A sweltering summer followed. The bitterly
	cold winter would really take its toll, for men used to temperate Australian conditions, the icy north wind and snowfalls cut right through the meagre protection
	offered by inadequate uniforms. Frequent rainfalls flooded the trenches and turned the battlefields to mud. Despite the rain and snow, drinking water was in short 
	supply. Water was rationed carefully and soldiers were so conscious of the shortages that they often shaved with leftover cold tea. Food was more plentiful, although
	lacking in variety. Fresh food was rarely available.</p>
	<p>Poor health was another major problem. Painful conditions and diseases such as trench foot, dysentry, diarrhoea and gastroenteritis were common in the damp conditions
	of the conditions of the trenches. Illness was spread by rats, lice, flies and mosquitoes. Many pests were attracted by the strong odour of decomposing bodies and human
	waste. Poor sanitation and poor food-handeling practices meant that germs were often transferred to food and water supplies.</p>
	<p>In December 1915, the Anzac's were finally ordered to withdraw from Gallipoli. To hide the fact they were leaving, they rigged up some rifles to fire at random.
	They did this by attaching tins to the rifles' trigger mechanisms with string. When the tins filled with water dripping from other tins suspended above, their weight
	caused the triggers to be pulled and the last Australian soldiers were evacuated overnight on 19-20 of December. Because of its effiency, the silent withdrawl is 
	usually remembered as the most successful part of the Gallipoli Campaign.</p>
	<p>Over the course of the campaign, 8709 Australians died, and 19000 were wounded. Over the same period, more than 80000 Turks were killed. During their time on
	Gallipoli, the 'diggers'- as Australian troops became known- displayed a courage and ingenuity that would form the basis of the Anzac legend.
	This legend would contribute greatly to the Australian sense of identity over the course of the 20th century.</p>
