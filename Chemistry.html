    <td colspan="2" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><h2>Chemical Reactions</h2>
<p>A chemical change is a change of materials into other, new materials with different properties, and one or more new substances are formed.<br>
A physical change are changes affecting the shape of a substance, but not its chemical composition.</p>

<h2>Atoms, Molecules and Compounds</h2>
<p>Atoms are the smallest unit of matter and cannot be broken down chemically into anything simpler. They are constituted of sub-atomic particles including electrons, protons and neutrons.
Protons and neutrons make up the nucleus (centre) of an atom while electrons form clouds on the outside.<br>
Atoms are classified as each belonging to a certain element based on the number of protons they have. For example, an atom with one proton is always hydrogen. The numbers of neutrons and electrons may change,
but at the core, the atom will always be hydrogen.</p>

<p>Molecules consist of two or more atoms held together by a covalent bond. Alternatively called a molecular bond, a covalent bond is a chemical link between two atoms in which the electron pairs are shared between them.</>

<p>A compound is a chemical substance made up of two or more elements held together through ionic bonds. Ionic bonds involve an electrical attraction between positively and negatively charged atoms.<p>

<p>The atoms within a compound also must be different from each other, whereas a molecule can consist of only one element.</p>

<h2>Reactants and Products</h2>
<p>The chemicals we have at the start of a reaction are called reactants.<br>
When a chemical reaction takes place, the atoms in these substances are rearranged to form new chemicals. The chemicals formed in the reaction are called products.</p>

<h2>Combustion</h2>
<p>Combustion is an exothermic reaction which usually involves the burning of fuels in the presence of air to produce heat and light through a flame. Fuel stores potential energy that can be released as heat when we burn the fuel.<br>
Methane, like other hydrocarbon fuels such as petrol, can undergo either complete or incomplete combustion. When methane undergoes complete combustion that is in a plentiful supply of air, it produces carbon dioxide, water and 
heat. This makes hydrocarbons very useful as fuels.<br>
When methane undergoes incomplete combustion that's in a limited supply of air, it produces either carbon monoxide and water, or carbon and water.</p>

<p>Energy is released by breaking the bonds between hydrogen and carbon atoms of the hydrocarbon and bonding them with oxygen to form CO2 and water. The bonding with oxygen releases more energy then was required to break apart
the original bonds. With incomplete combustion, some carbon atoms bond with only one oxygen atom, producing carbon monoxide. As well as the hazard from toxic gas, less energy is released since fewer CO bonds are formed.
At even lower effiencies, the carbon does not bond with any oxygen and is visible as soot. Incomplete combustion is not only inefficient, producing less heat energy than complete combustion, but is also harmful to the 
environment as pollutants.</p>
